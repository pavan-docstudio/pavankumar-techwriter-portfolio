Translate an unknown word just hovering on it! No clicks, no other information, just one translation.

Lingua Hover is an extension designed for easy translation on hover.
You can set a target language from the Google-based language list.
Also, you can add a keyboard shortcut to see a translation by holding down the key.

## Plans

- to add a custom vocabulary in which you can add your unknown words
- to add more settings for custom translation output
- to make a translation more detailed with other meanings
- to add a function of translating a whole sentence
