# How to make an online payment

:::info
<p>**About this sample**: This guide demonstrates a standard financial transaction flow (Mobile Top-up). Similar logic applies to B2C checkout processes in e-commerce.</p>
<p>**Goal**: Help users complete a payment with zero errors.</p>
<p>**Result**: The documentation met all requirements and compliance standards, resulting in a job offer from a major IT integrator.</p>
<p>**Evolution**: I create the [original content](https://github.com/slusimusi/portfolio/blob/66c7ed7d1a3bc70367e22b732149d87442777104/how-to-make-an-online-payment.md) as a time-boxed test task. Later, I refined and edited the text to align with STE principles for better clarity and conciseness.</p>
